Just my dotfiles for my Arch Linux machine. Mostly meant as an online backup for me. If you find some stuff usefull however, you're more than welcome to it.
Please be aware that my setup files for mutt, offlineimap, and irssi are mostly sourced from brisbin33 (http://www.pbrisbin.com:8080/). Thanks to him.

Thanks to all of you for inspiration!
