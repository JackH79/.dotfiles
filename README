Just my dotfiles for my Arch Linux machine. Mostly meant as an online backup for me. If you find some stuff usefull however, you're more than welcome to it.
Please be aware that my setup files for mutt, offlineimap, and irssi are mostly sourced from brisbin33 (http://www.pbrisbin.com:8080/). A big thank you to him. The rest is either cobbled together from various online sources (mostly bbs.archlinux.org) or (especially when the coding seems poor ;) ) selfmade.

Thanks to all of you!
