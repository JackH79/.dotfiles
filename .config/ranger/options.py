# This is the main configuration file of ranger.  It consists of python
# code, but fear not, you don't need any python knowledge for changing
# the settings.

# Lines beginning with # are comments.  To enable a line, remove the #.

# You can customize ranger in the file ~/.config/ranger/options.py.
# It has the same syntax as this file.  In fact, you can just copy this
# file there with `ranger --copy-config=options' and make your modifications.
# But make sure you update your configs when you update ranger.
