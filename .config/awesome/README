This is a major change of the structure of my awesome config. "rc.lua" is now split into multiple files, which will probably make it harder for beginners to follow the logic, but it was necessary as I implemented a new theme switcher. Due to the fact that my workplace in my new flat gets blasted by sunlight all day, it became necessary to get a light colour theme. I wanted to keep my dark theme as well though for the occasional night shift.
The theme switcher auto-loads either a bright or dark awesome, Xdefaults colour, and GTK scheme, depending on daytime (it does not change the theme automatically on-the-fly, but loads the appropriate one in case of awesome being (re-)started). It also offers a manual override through key binds to switch between the schemes in case light conditions do not match daytime.
The way the theme switcher is implemented is probably a rather crude way to do it, but it's the best I could come up with (no, I'm not a programmer :) ). If you know of a better and more elegant way, please drop me a line here at github. Thanks.
